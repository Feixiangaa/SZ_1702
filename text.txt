Take the spring festival as an example, traditionally, in the evening of the Chinese New Year eve, the whole family usually would have a reunion meal. Many of the family members are not really be at home quite often spending time with others especially with their old parents, so this reunion meal is very important for every family to have a chance to talk, enjoy the together time. But today all has changed. The most common look of the reunion meal now is that all young people eat quietly meanwhile the eyes are staring at their cell phone, checking out their “Friend Circle” to see if anyone update the status. They only make sounds when someone grab a red envelop with very lousy money in it. The old parents feel awkward when facing this weird situation, no one would even like to talk to them, the reunion meal turns out that there is just a bunch of strange people eating at the same table.
